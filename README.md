# JanusGraph.Net

JanusGraph.Net is the .NET driver of [JanusGraph][janusgraph]. It extends
Apache TinkerPopâ„¢'s [Gremlin.Net][gremlin.net] as its core dependency
with additional support for JanusGraph-specific types.

## Usage

JanusGraph.Net includes a `JanusGraphClientBuilder` that can be used to build
a `IGremlinClient` pre-configured for JanusGraph. This client can then be used
to configure a `GraphTraversalSource`:

```cs
var client = JanusGraphClientBuilder
    .BuildClientForServer(new GremlinServer("localhost", 8182))
    .Create();
// The client should be disposed on shut down to release resources
// and to close open connections with client.Dispose()
var g = new Graph().Traversal().WithRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection(client));
// Reuse 'g' across the application
```

The `GraphTraversalSource` `g` can now be used to spawn Gremlin traversals:

```cs
var herculesAge = g.V().Has("demigod", "name", "hercules").Values<int>("age")
    .Next();
Console.WriteLine($"Hercules is {herculesAge} years old.");
```

The traversal can also be executed asynchronously by using `Promise()` which is
recommended as the underlying driver in Gremlin.Net also works
asynchronously:

```cs
var herculesAge = await g.V().Has("demigod", "name", "hercules")
    .Values<int>("age")
    .Promise(t => t.Next());
```

Refer to the chapter [Gremlin Query Language][gremlin-chapter] in the
JanusGraph docs for an introduction to Gremlin and pointers to further
resources.
The main syntactical difference for Gremlin.Net is that it follows .NET naming
conventions, e.g., method names use PascalCase instead of camelCase.

### Text Predicates

The `Text` class provides methods for
[full-text and string searches][text-predicates]:

```cs
await g.V().Has("demigod", "name", Text.TextPrefix("herc"))
    .Promise(t => t.ToList());
```

The other text predicates can be used the same way.

### Geoshapes

The `Geoshape` class in the `JanusGraph.Net.Geoshapes` namespace can be used to
construct [Geoshapes][geoshapes]:

```cs
await g.V().Has("demigod", "name", "hercules").OutE("battled")
    .Has("place", Geoshape.Point(38.1f, 23.7f)).Count().Promise(t => t.Next());
```

Only the point Geoshape is supported right now.

## Version Compatibility

The lowest supported JanusGraph version is 0.3.0.
The following table shows the supported JanusGraph versions for each version
of JanusGraph.Net:

| JanusGraph.Net | JanusGraph |
|---|---|
| 0.1.z | 0.3.z |
| 0.2.z | 0.4.z, 0.5.z |

While it should also be possible to use JanusGraph.Net with other versions of
JanusGraph than mentioned here, compatibility is not tested and some
functionality (like added Gremlin steps) will not work as it is not supported
yet in case of an older JanusGraph version or was removed in a newer JanusGraph
version.

## Community

JanusGraph.Net uses the same communication channels as JanusGraph in general.
So, please refer to the
[_Community_ section in JanusGraph's main repository][janusgraph-community]
for more information about these various channels.

Please use GitHub issues only to report bugs or request features.
