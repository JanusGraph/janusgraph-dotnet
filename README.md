# JanusGraph.Net

JanusGraph.Net is the .NET driver of [JanusGraph][JanusGraph]. It extends
Apache TinkerPopâ„¢'s [Gremlin.Net][Gremlin.Net] as its core dependency
with additional support for JanusGraph-specific types.

## Documentation

JanusGraph.Net includes a `JanusGraphClientBuilder` that can be used to build
a `IGremlinClient` pre-configured for JanusGraph. This client can then be used
to configure a `GraphTraversalSource`:

```cs
var client = JanusGraphClientBuilder
    .BuildClientForServer(new GremlinServer("localhost", 8182))
    .Create();
var g = new Graph().Traversal().WithRemote(new DriverRemoteConnection(client));
```

The `Text` class provides methods for
[full-text and string searches][text-predicates].

The `Geoshape` class in the `JanusGraph.Net.Geoshapes` namespace can be used to
construct [Geoshapes][geoshapes].

## Community
